# dot
My dotfiles for [Coder](https://coder.com).

If you do not include a `install.sh`, all dotfiles will be symlinked to the home directory. The install script will attempt to do this as well, as it does other things. More info in the [docs](https://help.coder.com/hc/en-us/articles/360057616553-Personalizing-Your-Development-Environment).
